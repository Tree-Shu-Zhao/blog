## Introduction

Welcome to my personal blog! This is my first post built with Hugo and the beautiful PaperMod theme. I'm excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge through this platform.

## Why I Started This Blog

![PSU Image](psu.png)

There are several reasons why I decided to start blogging:

1. **Knowledge Sharing**: To share what I learn with the community
2. **Documentation**: To document my journey and experiences
3. **Connection**: To connect with like-minded individuals
4. **Growth**: To improve my writing and communication skills

## Features of This Blog

This blog is powered by some amazing technologies:

### Hugo Static Site Generator

Hugo is incredibly fast and flexible. Here's what makes it great:

- **Lightning Fast**: Build times are measured in milliseconds
- **Flexible**: Complete control over the site structure
- **Markdown Support**: Write content in simple markdown
- **No Database Required**: Everything is static files

### PaperMod Theme

The PaperMod theme provides:

- Clean and minimal design
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Fast page loads
- Mobile responsive
- Search functionality
- Social media integration

## Code Examples

One of the things I'll be sharing is code. Here's a simple example:

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
// A simple greeting function
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to my blog.`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

### Python Example

```python
# A Python greeting
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to my blog."

print(greet("World"))
```

## What to Expect

In this blog, I plan to cover various topics including:

- **Technology**: Programming, tools, and frameworks
- **Development**: Best practices and tutorials
- **Projects**: Showcasing personal and open-source projects
- **Learning**: Sharing resources and learning experiences
- **Tips & Tricks**: Productivity hacks and useful tips

## Tables Example

Here's an example of how tables look in this theme:

| Technology | Purpose | Experience |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Hugo | Static Site Generator | Beginner |
| Markdown | Content Writing | Intermediate |
| Git | Version Control | Advanced |
| JavaScript | Programming | Intermediate |

## Lists and Formatting

### Unordered List

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

### Ordered List

1. First step
2. Second step
   1. Sub-step A
   2. Sub-step B
3. Third step

### Text Formatting

You can use **bold text** for emphasis, *italic text* for subtle emphasis, and `inline code` for technical terms.

> This is a blockquote. It's useful for highlighting important information or quotes from other sources.

## Mathematical Expressions

This blog supports LaTeX mathematical expressions using KaTeX for fast, beautiful math rendering.

### Inline Math

You can write inline math expressions like $E = mc^2$ or $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$ directly in your text.

### Display Math

For larger equations, use display mode:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

### Complex Examples

#### Quadratic Formula
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

#### Matrix Operations
Matrices are supported too:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
  a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
  a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
  a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

#### Calculus
Derivatives and integrals:

$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x)$$

#### Statistics
Normal distribution probability density function:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}$$

#### Series and Limits
Taylor series expansion:

$$e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots$$

Limit definition of derivative:

$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

#### Physics Equations
Schrödinger equation:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x,t)\right]\Psi(x,t)$$

#### Set Theory
You can also use set notation: $A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}$

#### Greek Letters and Symbols
Greek letters like $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\Delta$, $\Omega$ and special symbols like $\infty$, $\nabla$, $\partial$, $\sum$, $\prod$ are all supported

## Images

You can add images to your posts. Just place them in the `static` folder and reference them:

```markdown
