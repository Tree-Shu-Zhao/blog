Welcome to my blog.\u0026#34; print(greet(\u0026#34;World\u0026#34;)) What to Expect In this blog, I plan to cover various topics including:\nTechnology: Programming, tools, and frameworks Development: Best practices and tutorials Projects: Showcasing personal and open-source projects Learning: Sharing resources and learning experiences Tips \u0026amp; Tricks: Productivity hacks and useful tips Tables Example Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of how tables look in this theme:\nTechnology Purpose Experience Hugo Static Site Generator Beginner Markdown Content Writing Intermediate Git Version Control Advanced JavaScript Programming Intermediate Lists and Formatting Unordered List First item Second item Nested item Another nested item Third item Ordered List First step Second step Sub-step A Sub-step B Third step Text Formatting You can use bold text for emphasis, italic text for subtle emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.\nThis is a blockquote. It\u0026rsquo;s useful for highlighting important information or quotes from other sources.\nMathematical Expressions This blog supports LaTeX mathematical expressions using KaTeX for fast, beautiful math rendering.\nInline Math You can write inline math expressions like $E = mc^2$ or $\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta = 1$ directly in your text.\nDisplay Math For larger equations, use display mode:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \\sqrt{\\pi}$$\nComplex Examples Quadratic Formula When $a \\ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$\nMatrix Operations Matrices are supported too:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} \u0026amp; a_{12} \u0026amp; a_{13} \\ a_{21} \u0026amp; a_{22} \u0026amp; a_{23} \\ a_{31} \u0026amp; a_{32} \u0026amp; a_{33} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nCalculus Derivatives and integrals:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\left( \\int_{0}^{x} f(u),du\\right)=f(x)$$\nStatistics Normal distribution probability density function:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2}$$\nSeries and Limits Taylor series expansion:\n$$e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\cdots$$\nLimit definition of derivative:\n$$f\u0026rsquo;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$\nPhysics Equations Schrödinger equation:\n$$i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi(x,t) = \\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + V(x,t)\\right]\\Psi(x,t)$$\nSet Theory You can also use set notation: $A \\cup B = {x : x \\in A \\text{ or } x \\in B}$\nGreek Letters and Symbols Greek letters like $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\Delta$, $\\Omega$ and special symbols like $\\infty$, $\\nabla$, $\\partial$, $\\sum$, $\\prod$ are all supported\nImages You can add images to your posts. Just place them in the static folder and reference them:\n![Alt text](/path/to/image.jpg) Links Here are some useful links:\nHugo Documentation PaperMod Wiki Markdown Guide Conclusion This is just the beginning of my blogging journey.
